## Terraform Generator (2)- Kubernetes 

This project consists of the python script tfgenk8s.py and four template files. Through the Jinja2 templating engine a Terraform file is generated which can be used to spin up a kubernetes cluster. The cloudinit files which are injected in the Terraformed nodes are generated by https://github.com/pblaas/cloudinit_generator. tfgenk8s.py will perform this task automaticly for you.

### Dependencies

* Terraform
* Python2.x
* Jinja2 python module
* git
* Openstack 'allow-all' security group for SNAT ports. 

### Usage

### Caveats
* HA master k8s setup
* Loadbalancing through LBAAS
* First three nodes are part of etcd2 cluster and have Master roles.
* etcd2 cluster inside k8s cluster.
